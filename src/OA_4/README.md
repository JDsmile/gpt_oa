Your task is to build a simple comment section using React. The application should have the following features:

Requirements:
A user can type a comment into a text box and submit it.

Each comment should have:
A timestamp showing when it was created.
A "Like" button that increments the number of likes for that comment.
Users should be able to delete individual comments.
Technical Constraints:
Use functional components and React hooks.
Manage state using the useState hook.
Format the timestamp to MM/DD/YYYY, HH:mm:ss.
Bonus Points:
Allow editing of comments.
