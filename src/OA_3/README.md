## Prompt: Dynamic Form Builder

### You are tasked with building a Dynamic Form Builder component. The app allows users to dynamically add fields to a form and collect the form values. The requirements are:

1. Add New Fields:

The user can add new fields by specifying:
Field label (e.g., "Name").
Field type (e.g., "text", "number", "email").

2. Remove Fields:

Each dynamically added field has a "Remove" button to delete it from the form.
Submit Form:

3. The form should display an object containing the current values of all fields when the user clicks the "Submit" button.

Expected Behavior
Initially, the form is empty, and a user can add new fields using an input and a dropdown.
Added fields are displayed with their respective input elements and labels.
The user can fill out the form, remove fields, or submit the form to see the current field value.s
